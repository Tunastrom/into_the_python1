# Python's class mechanism adds classes with a minimum of new syntax and semantics.
# it is a mixture of the class mechanisms found in C++ and Modula-3.

# Python classes provide all the standard features of Object Oriented Programming

#   a derived class can override any methods of its base class or classes,
#   and a method can call the method of a base class with the same name.

# Classes are created at runtime, and can be modified further after creation.
