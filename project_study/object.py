# object = abstracted data by python

# every object should have identity, type, value.
# identity will not changed if it is created once.
# you can think that is a address of object in memory.
# is Operator compare with two object's identities.

# related functions
# id()  return the value exchaned to integer from identity.
# type() return the object's type(it's also object, unchangable)

#mutable object: the values in this are changable.

#immutable object: the values in this are not changable.
#(But immutable container stored references to mutable objects \
# can't change stored mutable objects but values in stored mutable object)
